All android developer must have faced force close issue while developing an application.
Here is a library to catch that errors and treat it elegantly.

Catcho will create an error page kind of mechanism in your android application. So whenever your application is crashed user will not able to see that irritating pop up dialog. Instead of that app will display a predefined view to the user.

You can report any issue on issues page. **Note: If you speak Arabic, you can submit issues with Arabic language and I will check them. :)**

##Installation

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>net.alhazmy13.catcho</groupId>
<artifactId>library</artifactId>
<version>0.1.0-beta</version>
</dependency>

# Usage
--
Though it is very simple. Copy following line of code in your each (Activity or BaseActivity) class, just after the call of super method in your overriden onCreate method.

```java
        Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(new Catcho.Builder(this).recipients("your-email@domain.com").build());

```

Your Activity may look something like thisâ€¦

```java
public class AnyActivity extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(new Catcho.Builder(this).recipients("your-email@domain.com").build());

        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        // Your mechanism is ready now.. In this activity from anywhere 
        // if you get force close error it will be redirected to the Catcho.
    }
}
```
